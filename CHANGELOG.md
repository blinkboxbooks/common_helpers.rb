# Change log

## Open Source release (2015-01-28 14:11:21)

Today we have decided to publish parts of our codebase on Github under the [MIT licence](LICENCE). The licence is very permissive, but we will always appreciate hearing if and where our work is used!

## 0.1.0 ([#1](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Platform/common_helpers.rb/pull/1) 2014-10-07 07:55:34)
